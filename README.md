# virtual-pet
This project is an assignment for We Can Code It Bootcamp. It allows the student to pratice creating and using classes. It is a console application named Virtual Pet, created using Visual Studios. 

In this project the student is required to create a VirtualPet class, adding at least three properties and three methods.
Then, in the Program class we are to interact with the Virtual Pet we have created. 

For my project I created a virtual dragon as a pet.
