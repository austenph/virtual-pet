# virtual-pet
(Week 3 of We Can Code It Full-Stack .NET bootcamp weekend project)

Applied learning of basic C# practices (properties and methods) and introductory OOP principles (declaring and using classes).
Students were to create a console application that allowed a user to interaction with a pet, similar to Tamagotchi games.
The pet was required to have at least three methods (actions) and three properties (characteristics). 

My Virtual Pet is a pet dragon. You start by choosing your dragon egg. Then you hatch the egg and it
assigns you a color and gender. You can name your dragon and then it takes you to the interaction 
console menu where your pet dragon can either: play, train, hunt, eat, fly, or sleep. Each interaction 
effects the dragons energy level, skill level, food stock level, or hunger level. Depending on what you do (for example
eating with food stock) you can lose the game. As long as you keep your pet alive, the game takes you through different stages
of aging (based on how many times you have interacted with the dragon). Eventually your dragon becomes an elder dragon and the
game ends.
